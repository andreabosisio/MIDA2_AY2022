## Project structure

The main file to be compiled is `main.tex`.
The others source files have been imported with  `\input{nomefile}` and they shouldn't be directly compiled. Anyway, at the top of each source file there is the command `%!TEX root = ../main.tex`, thus, one can also compile the project by compiling whatever source `.tex` file.

## Updates & Errors

This is the result of the reviews and updates of class notes taken during A.Y. 2019-2020 and could contains errors and inaccuracies. Besides, no lecturer has reviewed the contents of this files. Therefore, use it at will and with responsibility.

### Other credits
The style of this LaTeX document is taken from another repository which contains the [MIDA1 (051588)](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=765793&polij_device_category=DESKTOP&__pj0=0&__pj1=c4cfdb62e79df118344594f5fd1ca434) lectures notes: [mida1 repo](https://github.com/teobucci/mida).
